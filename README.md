# Jeff-Phrasing Generator

This is a quick-and-dirty generator for outputting a list of chosen combinations
for [Jeff's phrasing dictionary for Plover](https://github.com/jthlim/jeff-phrasing)
in order to build custom practicing material.

# Status

This is largely untested/unverified and may have bugs.
Also, currently no support for _Simple Form_ and suffixes.

# Running

Import into Java IDE and build with Java 17.
Configure the set of phrases to build and run from `Generator.main()`.
Copy/paste the output (tab-separated) into Google Sheets/EXCEL or directly into [TypeyType](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type).
